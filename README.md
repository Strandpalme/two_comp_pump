two compatment model of the leech t cell with cell intrinsic plasticity

This model of the leech t cell is based on the model from my master thesis "Single- and Multi-Compartment Models of Cell Intrinsic Plasticity in Leech Neurons".
Response features that are explained by the model:
1. resting potential in trial 1
2. input resistance in trial 1 
3. change of input resistance over trials [delta R]
4. resting potential in trial 20
5. input resistance in trial 20
6. no spontaneous activity
7. number of spikes 1 nA
8. spike height 3rd spike
9. difference of amplitude between the 2nd and 3rd
10. voltage sag during hyperpolarization
11. number of spikes 0.5 nA
12. number of spikes 1.5 nA


By adding and fitting the pump activityover trials, the following features should be explained in addition:

1. resting potential for all trials between 1 and 20
2. input resistance for all trials between 1 and 20
3. Spike counts for 1 nA for all trieals between 1 and 20
